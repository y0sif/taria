# taria-mcp CLI

Every flag, environment variable and path rule the bridge binary reads.

```text
taria-mcp --socket <path>   Connect to an explicit Unix socket path
taria-mcp --app <label>     Derive the socket path for <label>
taria-mcp --help            Show help
```

Exactly one of `--socket` or `--app` is required.

Environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `TARIA_SOCK` | Socket path, used verbatim. Replaces the default on the app side always, and on the bridge side only when the path is derived from `--app`; an explicit `--socket` wins over it. |
| `TARIA_LOG` | Bridge log filter (tracing env-filter syntax), default `info`. Logs go to stderr; stdout carries MCP. |

With `--app <label>`, the bridge resolves the socket path the same way the
app-side adapter does when binding:

1. `$TARIA_SOCK`, if set and non-empty (used verbatim);
2. `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/taria/<label>.sock`;
3. `<temp dir>/taria-<user>/<label>.sock`, where `<user>` is the effective
   uid where it is available (through `/proc/self` on Linux), else `$USER`,
   else `$LOGNAME`, else the literal `default`.

The label is interpolated into a file name, so it has to be one. Both sides
refuse a label carrying a path separator, or `.`, `..` or empty, because the
app-side adapter binds and unlinks whatever the label resolves to. `--socket`
is how to name a path.
